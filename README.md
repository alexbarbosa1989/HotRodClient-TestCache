# HotRodClient-TestCache
Data Grid cache encoding tests:

- datagrid-jboss-marshalling: implements the generic GenericJBossMarshaller to store and retrieve data.
- datagrid-protostream: implements protostream to store and retrieve structured data. 

The current project requires a running RHDG instance. It was developed and tested using Data Grid 8.4 and OpenJDK 11.
